Comp Graphic and Visualization


How do I approach designing software?

For this project I started by creating a 2D image and broke the image down into shapes. This helped me figure out what shapes I will be making with OpenGL and how they will be placed in the scene. After that I did a tutorial to practice making those shapes with the tutorials the class provided. These tactics could be used in future work by following the same path before starting to code the main program. 


How do I approach developing programs?

While working on my program I used existing code found in the class tutorials and on the internet to help me build shapes. I made edits to these codes to fit my goal for the project. This included how to add lighting and movement to the camera. This is a very common strategy when making a program like this. 



How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

computational graphics and visualizations gave me skills in software development that can be applied in your future professional pathway.
